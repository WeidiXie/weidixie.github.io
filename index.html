                 I'm joining <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> as an Associate Professor.<br> <br>

                 I remain a visitor researcher with <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/">Visual Geometry Group (VGG)</a> at Oxford,
                 where I have spent seven wonderful years, completed DPhil and worked as a Senior Research Fellow afterwards.<br> <br>

                I'm generally interested in understanding how visual perception emerges. 
                In particular, on topics:  <br> <br>
                  <li> artificial intelligence for science (AI4Science). <br> <br>
                  <li> learning visual representations from self-supervised training. <br> <br>
                  <li> multi-modal co-training with visual apperance, motion, audio, textual description, etc. <br> <br>
                  <li> open-world, object-centric representation learning.<br> <br>                  
                  <li> learning visual representation for embodied agents.
